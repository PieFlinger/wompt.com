h1 Privacy Policy

h2 Website Visitors

p Like most website operators, Wompt collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Wompt’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Wompt’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Wompt may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

p Wompt also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Wompt only discloses IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.

h2 Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

p Certain visitors to Wompt’s websites choose to interact with Wompt in ways that require Wompt to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Wompt gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for chat at Wompt.com to provide identification from a third party, which may include an email address. Wompt collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Wompt. Wompt does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

h2 Aggregated Statistics

p Wompt may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Wompt may monitor the most popular chat rooms on the Wompt.com site. Wompt may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Wompt does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

h2 Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

p Wompt discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Wompt’s behalf or to provide services available at Wompt’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Wompt’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Wompt will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Wompt discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena or court order, or when Wompt believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Wompt, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Wompt website and have supplied your email address, Wompt may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Wompt and our products. We expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Wompt takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

h2 Cookies

p A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Wompt uses cookies to help Wompt identify and track visitors, their usage of Wompt website, and their website access preferences. Wompt visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Wompt’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Wompt’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

h2 Privacy Policy Changes

p Although most changes are likely to be minor, Wompt may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Wompt’s sole discretion. Wompt encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
